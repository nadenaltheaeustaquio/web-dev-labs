    <h2>Watering Basics</h2>
    <p>
      Watering plants may seem simple, but it is one of the most common struggles for beginners. Too
      much water can cause roots to rot, while too little water makes plants weak and dry. The best
      approach is to water deeply but less often, so roots grow strong. Check the soil before watering.
      Stick your finger about two inches deep—if it feels dry, it’s time to water. Most plants prefer
      morning watering, which reduces evaporation and allows leaves to dry during the day. Containers
      usually need more frequent watering since soil dries faster. Avoid watering directly on leaves;
      instead, aim for the soil near the base. Each plant has unique needs, so observe how your plants
      react. Wilting can mean underwatering, but yellowing leaves might mean overwatering. With practice,
      you will learn the balance and create a healthy routine for your plants.
