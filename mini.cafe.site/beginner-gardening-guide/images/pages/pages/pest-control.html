    <h2>Pest Control</h2>
    <p>
      Pests are a natural part of gardening, but they do not have to ruin your plants. Beginners often
      panic when they see insects, but not all bugs are harmful. Ladybugs and bees, for example, are
      beneficial. For harmful pests like aphids or caterpillars, start with simple and natural solutions.
      Spraying soapy water can help remove small insects without chemicals. Neem oil is another natural
      option that repels many pests. Handpicking caterpillars or snails may sound simple but is effective.
      Keep your garden clean by removing dead leaves and weeds where pests hide. Companion planting, such
      as growing marigolds near vegetables, can also help repel insects. Remember, healthy plants are more
      resistant to pests, so proper watering and soil care are your best defenses. Avoid using strong
      chemical pesticides, especially if you are growing edible plants. Natural control is safer and
      keeps your garden balanced.
