    <h2>Choosing Plants</h2>
    <p>
      Choosing the right plants is one of the most exciting steps for beginners. Start with plants that
      are easy to care for and grow quickly. Herbs such as basil, mint, and parsley are great because
      they sprout fast and are useful in cooking. For vegetables, try lettuce, tomatoes, or green beans.
      These are common beginner-friendly crops. If you want flowers, marigolds and sunflowers are good
      options because they are hardy and brighten up any garden. When choosing, consider your available
      space and sunlight. If you only have partial sun, pick shade-tolerant plants like spinach or kale.
      Container plants should be compact and not require deep roots. Avoid plants that need too much
      attention or are sensitive to pests. Beginners often do best with plants that grow in 1â€“2 months,
      giving you quick results and motivation. Remember: start small, learn their needs, and enjoy your
      progress before trying more challenging varieties.
