    <h2>DIY Projects</h2>
    <p>
      Gardening becomes more fun when you add creativity. DIY projects allow you to recycle materials
      and save money while improving your garden. One simple project is making pots from old containers
      such as plastic bottles, tin cans, or jars. Just add drainage holes and decorate them. Another idea
      is creating a compost bin from a plastic bucket. Composting reduces kitchen waste and gives you
      natural fertilizer. For small spaces, try a vertical garden using hanging shoe organizers or wooden
      pallets. You can grow herbs or flowers in each pocket. Another project is building a watering system
      using recycled plastic bottlesâ€”perfect for busy days. Kids also enjoy painting stones as plant
      markers, which makes gardening more fun. DIY projects not only save money but also let you express
      your creativity. They show that gardening is not just about plants but also about personal touches
      that make your garden unique.
