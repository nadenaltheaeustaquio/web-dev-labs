    <h2>Common Mistakes</h2>
    <p>
      Every beginner makes mistakes, and that is part of the learning process. However, some common
      errors can be avoided with awareness. Overwatering is one of the most frequent mistakes, often
      made by beginners who think more water means healthier plants. Another mistake is planting too
      many crops at once, which becomes overwhelming to maintain. Beginners may also forget to check
      sunlight needs, resulting in weak or leggy plants. Using poor soil without adding nutrients is
      another problem that affects growth. Some new gardeners also place pots without drainage, causing
      roots to rot. Patience is also keyâ€”expecting quick results can lead to frustration. Plants take
      time, and growth may not always be visible right away. The best way to avoid these mistakes is to
      start small, observe your plants, and adjust based on their needs. Gardening is about progress,
      not perfection.
