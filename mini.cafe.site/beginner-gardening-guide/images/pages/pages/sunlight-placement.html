    <h2>Sunlight & Placement</h2>
    <p>
      Sunlight is one of the most important factors in gardening. Without enough light, plants will
      grow weak and may not produce fruits or flowers. Most vegetables need 6–8 hours of sunlight daily.
      Herbs and leafy greens can often thrive with 4–6 hours. Observe your space during the day to see
      where sunlight falls. South-facing windows and balconies usually receive the most light. If your
      area has limited sunlight, choose plants that can tolerate shade, such as spinach or lettuce.
      Placement also matters—ensure plants are not crowded, so they can receive both light and airflow.
      Poor airflow can lead to pests and disease. If you live in an apartment, try vertical gardens or
      hanging planters near windows. Sunlight gives energy to plants through photosynthesis, so making
      the right placement choices will keep your garden thriving.
